Performance Comparison and Analysis

Greedy Algorithm (find_coins_greedy): Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of coin denominations. Efficiency: Fast and efficient when the denominations are in standard form (like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50). Drawbacks: The greedy algorithm may not provide the optimal solution for all sets of denominations. For example, if the denominations were [1, 3, 4], and you needed to make 6, the greedy approach might fail to find the minimum number of coins.

Dynamic Programming (find_min_coins): Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the amount and m is the number of coin denominations. Efficiency: Guarantees the optimal solution with the minimum number of coins for any set of denominations. Drawbacks: Slightly more complex and slower than the greedy approach due to the dynamic table construction, especially for large amounts.

Summary: For standard coin denominations like [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50], the greedy algorithm is generally faster and works perfectly. For arbitrary or non-standard coin denominations, the dynamic programming approach is more reliable and always provides the minimum number of coins needed.
